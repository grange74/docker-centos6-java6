Docker image with CentOS 6 & Java 6
============================
This repo contains a docker image build file that includes CentOS 6 & Java 6. 

The intention was to learn about Docker and try to mirror a production like environment running an older Java 6 web application.

The `Dockerfile` was created from reading examples from a variety of sources (GitHub, Docker Hub and other internet sites) and also trial and error. 

Build this image using `./build.sh`
